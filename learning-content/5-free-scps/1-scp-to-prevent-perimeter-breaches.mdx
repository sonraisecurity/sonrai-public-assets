### EASY NO BRAINER

#### Prevent perimeter breaches

This SCP denies identities the ability to bypass network controls and helps prevent holes in your cloud perimeter. It works by blocking identities that are not authorized by AWS IAM from using presigned URLs â€“ an easy method used to avoid authentication. Specifically, these help prevent unauthorized access to SageMaker resources and Lambda functions.
